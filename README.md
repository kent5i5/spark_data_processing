# ELT Data Processing Project 

## In this project, I will use Apache Spark to process my data. Apache Spark is a in-memory processing engine for big data processing which is 10 times faster than traditional Hadoop MapReduce proecessing because it provides high-level operators such as 'map' to process data on run-time instead of read/write from disk.
